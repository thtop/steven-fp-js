## Introducing Functional Programming

- Functional Programming is a programming paradigm or a way to approach programming.

> A person that only konws one way to do a thing is at a greater disadvantage than a person that knows multiple ways to accomplish the same thing.

### Definition

> Functional programming is the process of building software by **composing pure functions**, avoiding **shared state**, **mutable data**, and **side-effects**. Functional programming is **declarative rather than imperative**, and application state flows through pure functions.

by Eric Elliott
