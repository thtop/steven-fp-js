  ### Making the Most of this Course
  - In order to get the most out of this course, I recommend that you take advantage of the following:
  - **Sample Files**. Whenever I'm presenting JavaScript code for a concept in the course, I normally provide that code as a download. I recommend that you download the files and follow along or try it on your own. This is important in helping you grasp the concepts presented.
  - **Exercises**. This course contains several exercises. Each exercise will have a getting started lecture and then a second, follow-up lecture in which I will go through the exercise with you. Download the exercise files, and begin with the start folder once you have watched the getting started lecture. You can always look at the files in the finished folder or watch the second topic to see how you are doing. You may find it helpful to do exercises more than once.
  - **Review Links**. There are certain JavaScript concepts that are important to understand in order to grasp functional programming topics. When concepts are important I provide a review by linking to tutorials I've published on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRQhZGXC0WK85YRXl7nGX0w). If you are unsure of the JavaScript concept, make sure you review those tutorials.
